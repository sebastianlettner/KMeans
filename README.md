# KMeans
Implementation of the k-means algorithm in C.


The program cant read in 2D points from file (for exact syntax please look in input1 or input2) and run k-means clustering on it. The resulting clusters as well as the inital centroid point are saved in the files "centorids" and "init_centroids".
There is also a Matlab plot function available which can make a nice plot of the results.
